# Changelog

All notable changes to this fork are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Added searchable plugin settings in Obsidian 1.13.0 and newer while preserving the standard settings page on older supported Obsidian versions.

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-24

### Added

- Added a `Show cleanup logs` toggle to suppress the log modal after successful cleanup while continuing to show logs for errors. (renamed “Delete logs” toggle because the naming was not clear)
- Added an `Excluded file extensions` setting that always keeps the listed file types, whether or not they are linked from a note (case insensitive, leading dot optional).

- Added a collapsible protected-files section to the cleanup review dialog that lists the unused files your exclusion settings are keeping, so it is clear what was left behind and why.
- Added a protected-files view to the cleanup review dialog for vaults where every unused file is excluded, replacing the delete confirmation with a read-only summary.

### Fixed

- Listed unused files protected by excluded extensions in the cleanup review dialog alongside those protected by excluded folders, so a vault whose only unused files are excluded no longer reports that all attachments are used.

### Security

- Updated locked development dependencies to resolve findings reported by the release audit.

### Contributors

- Thanks to [@WolfExplode](https://github.com/WolfExplode) for their first merged contribution in [#10](https://github.com/Puhhh/clear-unused-images-obsidian/pull/10).
