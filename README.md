Clear Unused Images Plus is an Obsidian plugin for finding and deleting images that are no longer referenced in your vault. It scans markdown notes, supported frontmatter references, canvas files, and attachment links, then compares those references against image files in the vault.

Use it when attachments accumulate over time and you want cleanup to follow Obsidian's own deletion behavior instead of bypassing your vault settings.

This project is a maintained fork of [`oz-clear-unused-images`](https://github.com/ozntel/oz-clear-unused-images-obsidian). The current fork is maintained by [Aleksei B](https://github.com/Puhhh). The original plugin author is [Ozan](https://www.ozan.pl).

See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for release history.

## Installation

**Requirements**: Obsidian 1.8.10 or newer.

1. Open Obsidian Settings.
2. Go to Community plugins.
3. Install `Clear Unused Images Plus`.
4. Activate the plugin from Community Plugins.
5. Configure Obsidian's file deletion preference before running cleanup.

## Quick Start

1. Set Obsidian's file deletion preference to system trash or local `.trash`.
2. Run `Clear unused images` from the Command Palette.
3. Review the cleanup log after deletion completes.
4. Add excluded folders if the plugin reports files you want to keep outside normal note references.

## Usage

Deleted files and folders follow Obsidian's own file deletion preference:

- If Obsidian is configured to use system trash, cleanup moves files to system trash.
- If Obsidian is configured to use local trash, cleanup moves files to `.trash` inside the vault.

The plugin provides three cleanup commands:

- `Clear unused images` checks only image files. It is limited to jpg, jpeg, png, gif, svg, bmp, and webp.
- `Clear unused attachments` checks all non-note attachments in the vault, not just images. This can include PDFs, audio, video, archives, and other non-markdown files.
- `Clear unused folders` removes empty folders recursively, starting with the deepest folders first. It follows Obsidian's file deletion preference and keeps folders under excluded folder paths.

Use `Clear unused images` for routine image cleanup. Use `Clear unused attachments` more carefully because it has a wider scope and can delete any attachment the plugin cannot find referenced in notes, canvas files, or supported frontmatter references. The attachment cleanup flow shows a review modal before deletion. Use `Clear unused folders` after file cleanup if you want to remove empty folder structure left behind, or enable `Clear empty folders after image cleanup` to do that automatically.

You can run cleanup from the ribbon icon or from the Command Palette with `Ctrl/Cmd + P`.

Enable `Show cleanup logs` in the plugin settings to show a modal with information about deleted files. Disable it to keep successful cleanup runs to a brief notice; cleanup errors still show their logs:

If all images are still used, the plugin reports that nothing was deleted:

### Automatic Cleanup

Enable `Clean Images On Vault Load` to run image cleanup once after the vault layout is ready:

![Clean images on vault load](docs/assets/clean-images-on-vault-load.png)

- The startup cleanup only runs the image cleanup flow, not `Clear unused attachments`.
- If you enable the setting while Obsidian is already open, the change takes effect on the next vault load.

Enable `Clean Images Every X Minutes` to run recurring image cleanup while Obsidian stays open:

![Cleanup interval](docs/assets/cleanup-interval.png)

- The first periodic cleanup waits the full configured interval.
- If both automatic modes are enabled, the vault-load cleanup runs once and periodic cleanup starts later on its normal interval.
- Changing the toggle or interval updates the scheduler for the current session.

Enable `Clear empty folders after image cleanup` to remove folders that become empty after unused image cleanup deletes images:

![Clear empty folders](docs/assets/clear-empty-folders.png)

- This setting applies to `Clear unused images`, `Clean Images On Vault Load`, and `Clean Images Every X Minutes`.
- It does not change `Clear unused attachments`.
- It only removes folders that directly contained images deleted by that cleanup run.

### Excluded Folders

Use excluded folders to prevent cleanup from deleting files under specific vault paths. Separate multiple folders with commas and provide full paths inside the vault.

![Excluded folders](docs/assets/excluded-folders.png)

Turn on `Exclude subfolders` if the excluded paths should protect every child folder too:

![Exclude subfolders](docs/assets/exclude-subfolders.png)

### Excluded File Extensions

Use `Excluded file extensions` to keep specific file types regardless of whether they are linked from any note. Separate extensions with commas; matching is case insensitive and a leading dot is optional (`pdf, .mp4` both work). This is handy when you store files in the vault but never attach them — for example PDFs opened with Obsidian's PDF viewer.

## Development

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
npm test
npm run build
```

- `npm ci` installs the locked dependency set used by CI and release builds.
- `npm install` is fine when you intentionally update dependencies.
- `npm run dev` builds in watch mode.
- `npm test` runs the Vitest suite.
- `npm run build` creates the production `main.js` bundle.
- After `npm run build`, refresh the installed vault copy before manual testing:

```bash
cp main.js .obsidian/plugins/clear-unused-images-plus/main.js
cp styles.css .obsidian/plugins/clear-unused-images-plus/styles.css
```

- To verify the installed copy is current, compare the files directly:

```bash
git diff --no-index -- main.js .obsidian/plugins/clear-unused-images-plus/main.js
git diff --no-index -- styles.css .obsidian/plugins/clear-unused-images-plus/styles.css
```

No output means the local Obsidian plugin copy is in sync.

## Release

GitHub Releases are published by GitHub Actions when a version tag is pushed.

1. Update `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `manifest.json`, `versions.json`, and `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Run `npm run lint`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
3. Copy `main.js` and `styles.css` into `.obsidian/plugins/clear-unused-images-plus/` for manual Obsidian verification.
4. Commit the release changes, open a pull request into `main`, and merge it.
5. Create and push a version tag from `main`:

```bash
git tag -s -m "X.Y.Z" X.Y.Z HEAD
git push origin main
git push origin X.Y.Z
```

The release workflow verifies that the tag version matches `package.json`, `manifest.json`, and `versions.json`, runs the release audit, rebuilds `main.js`, creates GitHub artifact attestations, and uploads `manifest.json`, `main.js`, and `styles.css` as release assets. Obsidian requires the GitHub release tag to match `manifest.json` exactly, so use `1.0.0`, not `v1.0.0`.

## Project Structure

- `src/main.ts` - Obsidian plugin entry point
- `src/util.ts` - vault scanning and cleanup orchestration
- `src/linkDetector.ts` - markdown and wikilink reference detection
- `src/referenceUtils.ts` - pure reference and path helpers
- `src/folderCleanup.ts` - empty-folder cleanup behavior
- `tests/` - regression coverage for cleanup, references, settings, and scheduling
- `docs/assets/` - screenshot assets used in this README
- `styles.css` - plugin styles
- `main.js` - built plugin bundle

## Testing

Tests use `vitest`, with `jsdom` available through per-file `@vitest-environment jsdom` comments when DOM coverage is needed. The most important coverage is around markdown links, wikilinks, frontmatter references, canvas parsing, excluded folders, delete failure handling, and startup or periodic cleanup scheduling. Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before publishing changes.

When fixing safety bugs, add a focused regression first, verify it fails, then fix the implementation. For deletion or exclusion bugs, cover both helper behavior and cleanup-flow results.

## Notes

- The plugin targets Obsidian vault cleanup and does not require a separate backend.
- `main.js` is generated; do not edit it by hand.
- The local development copy in `.obsidian/plugins/clear-unused-images-plus/` is for testing only and is not part of the Git repository.
- Manual Obsidian checks should include markdown links, wikilinks, frontmatter image references, canvas-linked files, excluded folders, and Obsidian-configured trash.
